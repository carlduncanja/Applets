# AI-Powered Version Control & Iteration

## 🎯 Overview

Your apps now support **AI-powered iteration** and **version control**! You can:
- ✨ Improve apps with natural language prompts
- 📚 Automatic version history tracking
- ⏮️ Rollback to any previous version
- 🔄 Iterate indefinitely on your apps

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Improve an App with AI

When viewing any app, click the **"Improve with AI"** button:

**Example Improvements:**
```
"Add a dark mode toggle at the top"
"Change all button colors to blue"
"Add sound effects when clicking buttons"
"Improve the layout to be more modern"
"Add animation when adding items"
"Make the design more colorful"
"Add a settings panel"
"Include keyboard shortcuts"
```

The AI will:
- Understand your changes
- Maintain existing functionality
- Apply the improvements
- Save the previous version automatically

### 2. View Version History

Click the **version badge** (e.g., "v2") to see all versions:

- **Current Version** - highlighted with purple border
- **Previous Versions** - listed with timestamps
- Each version shows:
  - Version number
  - Description
  - Timestamp
  - Restore button

### 3. Rollback to Previous Version

In the version history dialog, click **"Restore"** on any previous version:

- Instantly reverts to that version
- Current version is saved before rollback
- No data loss - all versions preserved
- App reloads automatically

## 💡 Example Workflow

### Initial App: Simple Calculator
```
v1: Basic calculator with +, -, ×, ÷
```

### Iteration 1: Add History
```
Prompt: "Add a history panel showing the last 5 calculations"
Result: v2 with calculation history
```

### Iteration 2: Improve Design
```
Prompt: "Make it more colorful with gradient buttons"
Result: v3 with improved colors
```

### Iteration 3: Add Features
```
Prompt: "Add memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC) and percentage button"
Result: v4 with memory features
```

### Rollback Example
```
Don't like v4? Click "Restore" on v2 to go back!
```

## 📝 Writing Effective Iteration Prompts

### ✅ Good Prompts

**Be Specific:**
```
❌ "Make it better"
✅ "Add a dark mode toggle button in the top right corner"
```

**Describe the Feature:**
```
❌ "Add colors"
✅ "Change all buttons to use a blue gradient (from #3b82f6 to #1d4ed8)"
```

**Explain the Behavior:**
```
❌ "Add animation"
✅ "Add a smooth fade-in animation when new items are added to the list"
```

### 💡 Prompt Templates

**Add a Feature:**
```
"Add [feature] that allows users to [action]"
Example: "Add a filter dropdown that allows users to filter by status"
```

**Change Styling:**
```
"Change the [element] to use [color/style]"
Example: "Change the buttons to use rounded corners and purple colors"
```

**Improve Layout:**
```
"Reorganize the layout to [description]"
Example: "Reorganize the layout to have a sidebar on the left with controls"
```

**Add Interactivity:**
```
"Make [element] [action] when [event]"
Example: "Make items pulse when they're clicked"
```

## 🗄️ Database Structure

Each app stores complete version history:

```javascript
{
  name: "Calculator",
  version: 3,
  code: "current code...",
  description: "Calculator with history",
  versionHistory: [
    {
      version: 1,
      code: "v1 code...",
      description: "Basic calculator",
      timestamp: "2025-09-30T10:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      version: 2,
      code: "v2 code...",
      description: "Calculator with colors",
      timestamp: "2025-09-30T10:15:00Z"
    }
  ],
  lastIteration: {
    prompt: "Add gradient buttons",
    changes: "Added colorful gradient buttons and improved styling",
    timestamp: "2025-09-30T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Iteration Process

1. **User submits prompt** → Sent to `/api/apps/iterate`
2. **AI receives:**
   - Current app code
   - Original description
   - User's improvement request
3. **AI generates:**
   - Improved code
   - Updated description
   - Summary of changes
4. **System saves:**
   - Previous version to history
   - New version as current
   - Increment version number
5. **App reloads** with new code

### Rollback Process

1. **User clicks "Restore"** on version
2. **System:**
   - Saves current version to history (if not already there)
   - Retrieves target version from history
   - Updates current code/description
   - Sets version number
3. **App reloads** with restored code

### Version Storage

- **All versions preserved** in database
- **No version limit** - unlimited history
- **Efficient storage** - only code changes stored
- **Timestamps** for each version
- **Full metadata** preserved

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. **Iterative Development**
Start simple, improve gradually:
```
v1: Core functionality
v2: Basic styling
v3: Advanced features
v4: Polish and refinement
```

### 2. **Test Before Iterating**
- Use the current version first
- Identify what needs improvement
- Write specific prompts

### 3. **Keep Backups**
- Version history is automatic
- Test new versions
- Rollback if something breaks

### 4. **Document Changes**
The AI tracks changes, but you can also:
- Review version history
- Compare versions
- Track feature evolution

---

## 🚨 Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Component Name Must Stay Same**
   - Can't rename component in iterations
   - Structure must remain compatible

2. **No Merge Conflicts**
   - Linear version history
   - No branching (yet)

3. **Storage**
   - All versions stored in database
   - Can grow large with many iterations

4. **Breaking Changes**
   - AI tries to maintain compatibility
   - Major rewrites might break
   - Always test after iteration

2. v2: Try experimental feature
3. If good → iterate further
4. If bad → rollback to v1
```

### Case 3: Client Feedback
```

2. Show to client
3. Get feedback: "Make it more colorful"
4. v2: Apply feedback
5. Repeat until approved
```
